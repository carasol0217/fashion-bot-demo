# fashion-bot-demo

A simple neural network-based recommendation system built using PyTorch, this project aims to provide personalized clothing recommendations based on user-item interactions using collaborative filtering. This system uses a subset of the Polyvore dataset, a collection of fashion items, to suggest the best outfits or clothing items to users based on their preferences.

## Dataset

A cleaned Polyvore data set was used from this repository owned by Aemika Chow: [Cleaned Maryland Dataset](https://github.com/AemikaChow/AiDLab-fAshIon-Data/blob/main/Datasets/cleaned-maryland.md)
